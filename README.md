## Day 1 - Introduction to Verilog RTL Design and Synthesis

### Introduction to Iverilog and GTKWave

**Stimulator:**  
Stimulates the RTL design and compares its output to specifications. We use **Icarus Verilog (Iverilog)** as the simulator tool.

**Testbench:**  
Applies stimulus to the design to check its functionality.

The stimulator monitors changes in input and evaluates the output by providing primary inputs and observing primary outputs.

**Simulation Flow:**  
- Input design and testbench files are provided to **Iverilog**, which generates a **VCD (Value Change Dump)** file containing signal changes over time.
- The VCD file can be viewed using **GTKWave** for waveform analysis.

### Labs on Logic Simulation

After installing the tools, clone the lab module from [sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop](https://github.com/kunalg123/sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop).

**Directory Structure:**
- `lib`: Standard cell liberty files
- `my_lib`: Standard cell Verilog models
- `verilog_files`: Verilog source files and testbenches (testbenches start with `tb_`)

**Simulation Steps:**
1. Simulate design with Iverilog:
    ```sh
    iverilog <design_file.v> <testbench_file.v>
    # Example:
    iverilog good_mux.v tb_good_mux.v
    ```
2. Run the generated `a.out` file to produce the VCD file.
3. View the VCD file in GTKWave:
    ```sh
    gtkwave <VCD_file>
    # Example:
    gtkwave tb_good_mux.vcd
    ```
4. In GTKWave, select the testbench and the UUT (Unit Under Test) to view signals.
5. Drag required signals to the signal section and use "Zoom Fit" to see the full simulation window.
6. Use "Find Next/Previous Edge" to track signal transitions.

**Testbench Structure:**
- Instantiate the Unit Under Test (UUT)
- Initialize UUT inputs
- Generate stimulus by toggling inputs after a set time period

### Synthesis using Yosys

**Synthesis:**  
Converts behavioral RTL to gate-level netlist using a standard cell library.  
**Tool used:** Yosys

**Yosys Synthesis Flow:**
1. Read design:
    ```sh
    read_verilog <verilog_file>
    ```
2. Read liberty file:
    ```sh
    read_liberty -lib <liberty_file>
    ```
3. Start synthesis:
    ```sh
    synth -top <module_name>
    ```
4. Generate gate-level netlist:
    ```sh
    abc -liberty <liberty_file>
    ```
5. Visualize netlist (requires Python 3.12+ and setuptools):
    ```sh
    show
    ```
6. Write netlist:
    ```sh
    write_verilog -noattr <output_netlist.v>
    ```

**Notes:**
- After synthesis, stimulate the generated netlist with the same testbench used for RTL and compare outputs.
- Standard cell libraries contain various logic gates (AND, OR, DFF, etc.) with different threshold voltages and drive strengths.
- Cell selection during synthesis is critical for timing and power optimization.
